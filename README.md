# MLB-Pitch-Arsenal-Analysis
This project analyzes Major League Baseball (MLB) pitch arsenals to identify the most effective pitch combinations using advanced statistics and R-based modeling. By combining velocity, spin rate, and sequencing data, I evaluated how different pitch mixes (pairs, trios, and five-pitch arsenals) impact run value and overall effectiveness.
